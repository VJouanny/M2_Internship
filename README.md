# M2 Internship: Two-mode squeezing in Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers.

## Short description of the codes:

* 2modeSqueezing.ipynb
  Code used to obtain numerically the covariance matrix for the two-mode squeezed states from a quantum mechanical point of view using [QuTiP](https://github.com/qutip/qutip)
  
* CalibrationDataAnalysisFakeData.ipynb
  Code used to do the 2-mode digital down conversion, extract the covariance matrix and play with the parameters.
  
* CalibrationSavingData.ipynb
  Code used to save the data from the RedPitaya board using [QCodes](https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes) and the [RedPitaya driver](https://github.com/QCoherence/QCodes-drivers).
